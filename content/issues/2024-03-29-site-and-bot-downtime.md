At Flexa Group we prioritise your safety of your data over anything. We have recently discovered a vulnerability in the site that has caused us to remove access to the site for the time being whilst we over look this and fix this issue.

The bot is now online and we are working on getting our websites security up to levels where your data is secured completely.

Wï»¿e have maintained security levels and have worked with a higher up team to provide higher security on our files and data.
